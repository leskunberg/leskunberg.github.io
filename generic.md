Our world is given meaning by our memories associated with words. It is easy to imagine an ice covered pond, it is also easy to tell someone that you envision an ice covered pond. What is difficult is to describe the color of the ice. It is also difficult to describe consistently an uprooted tree. Industrial and battlespace accidents can be avoided by real time communication with accuracy. Identification of threats and dangers as well as reporting of said threats can be extremely difficult, especially when seconds can be the difference between life and death.

Meanings of our words fit patterns of culture and lifestyle. Perception is reality and our brains subconciously process information regardless of our own personal biases. Modeling brain activity can be inconsistent between person to person. Our aim is to ensure cybernetics is easy to deploy and use in real world scenarios.
